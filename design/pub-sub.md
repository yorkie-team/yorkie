# PubSub

## Summary

Yorkie needs to share events happening in documents with different clients. For
this, we implemented this feature using gRPC server-side stream and the PubSub
pattern.

### Goals

We should be able to share events with other clients who are subscribing to
Documents.

## Proposal Details

### How does it work?

Yorkie implements WatchDocuments API
using [gRPC server-side streaming](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/basics/#server-side-streaming-rpc)
to deliver the events that have occurred to other clients.

```protobuf
// api/yorkie.proto

service Yorkie {
    ...
  rpc WatchDocuments (WatchDocumentsRequest) returns (stream WatchDocumentsResponse) {}
}
```

And to manage the event delivery target, we are using
the [PubSub pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)
. You can learn more by looking at
the [sync package](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/tree/main/yorkie/backend/sync)
we are implementing.

The order of operation is as follows.

1. The WatchDocuments API creates a `Subscription` instance with the client and
   document keys.
2. Subscription instance internally manages the `DocEvent channel`, and the
   WatchDocuments API uses a select statement to retrieve events passed to the
   Subscription instance.
3. The client can deliver the event to the Subscription instances that are
   subscribed to the same document through
   the `Publish(publisherID *time.ActorID, topic string, event DocEvent)`
   method.
4. In the select statement mentioned earlier, when an event is confirmed, it is
   sent to the stream server.

### Risks and Mitigation

Currently, Subscription instances are managed in memory. This can be a problem
when building a cluster of servers.  
To solve this problem, we are planning to support cluster-mode
using [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd).
