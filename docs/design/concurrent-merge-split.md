# Concurrent Merge and Split

## Problem

When two clients concurrently perform merge or split operations on the same
tree region, replicas diverge after synchronization.

### Goals

- Fix convergence bugs in concurrent merge/split.
- Preserve backward compatibility: no protobuf or protocol changes (except
  persisting `MergedFrom`/`MergedAt` on snapshot — backwards-compatible).

### Non-Goals

- Undo/redo for merge/split (deferred per `undo-redo.md` Phase 2).
- General-purpose `Tree.Move` operation (Phase 2).

## Edit Execution Flow

```text

  ├── 01:   FindTreeNodesWithSplitText(from/to) — resolve CRDTTreePos
  ├── 01-1: advancePastUnknownSplitSiblings (Fix 7)
  ├── 02:   collectBetween — walk range, detect merge/delete targets
  ├── 03:   Delete — tombstone nodes
  ├── 04:   Merge — move children to fromParent, set mergedInto
  ├── 04-1: Propagate deletes to merge-moved children (Fix 5)
  ├── 05:   Split — SplitElement for splitLevel > 0
  └── 06:   Insert — with parent-deletion guard + merge redirect
```

## Fixes

### Fix 1: Split sibling cascade delete

**`collectBetween`** — When deleting an element, follow its `InsNextID`
chain to include split siblings unknown to the editor's VV. Element-only;
text splits use same-CreatedAt offset IDs that `findFloorNode` resolves.

### Fix 2: Moved children guard

**`collectBetween`** — Exclude children whose parent is in
`toBeMergedNodes` from the parent-cascade delete. These children are
being moved by merge, not deleted.

### Fix 3: Merge-tombstone insert redirect

**`FindTreeNodesWithSplitText`** — When the resolved parent is
tombstoned by a merge, redirect to the merge destination via `mergedInto`.

### Fix 4: mergedInto forwarding pointer

**`Edit` Step 04, `TreeNode`** — Runtime cache `mergedInto *TreeNodeID`
on merge-source nodes. Set during merge; rebuilt from `MergedFrom` on
snapshot load via `rebuildMergeState`. Enables fast nil-check in
`FindTreeNodesWithSplitText`.

### Fix 5: Delete propagation to merge-moved children

**`Edit` Step 04-1** — When a merge-source is deleted (not merged),
tombstone its former children in the merge target. Identified via
`child.MergedFrom == source.id`. Skip when `mergedInto == fromParent`
(concurrent merge, not delete).

### Fix 6: Inverted range no-op

**`traverseInPosRange`** — When a merge redirects `to` before `from`,
treat the empty range as a no-op.

### Fix 7: Split sibling forwarding

**`Edit` Step 01-1, `Style`, `RemoveStyle`** — After resolving positions,
advance `fromLeft`/`toLeft` past element split siblings whose `CreatedAt`
is not in the editor's VV. Skip when `leftNode == parent` (leftmost).
Prevents multi-level split mispositioning, side-by-side insert/delete
errors.

### Fix 8: SplitElement skips merge-moved children

**`SplitElement`, `mergeNodes`** — Persist `MergedFrom` (source parent ID)
and `MergedAt` (immutable merge ticket) on moved children. In
`SplitElement`, keep right-partition children with `MergedFrom` in the
original node when the merge source was a child of the split node and
the editor's VV doesn't cover `MergedAt`. `MergedAt` is captured
explicitly because `source.removedAt` can be overwritten by LWW.

### Fix 9: Skip merge for concurrent elements

**`collectBetween`** — When a delete range crosses into an element whose
`CreatedAt` is not in the editor's VV, skip merge detection. The boundary
crossing is an artifact of a concurrent split.

### Fix 10: JS splitElement preserves tombstoned children

**`index_tree.ts`** — Use `_children` (raw) instead of `children`
(filtered) in `splitElement` to preserve tombstoned children across
splits.

### Fix 11: End-token split sibling guard for Style/RemoveStyle

**`Style`, `RemoveStyle` callbacks** — When processing an End token,
skip styling if the node has an `InsNextID` split sibling not in the
editor's VV. The End token is in the range only because a concurrent
split extended the traversal past the original element boundary.

Helper: `hasUnknownSplitSibling(node, vv)` — follows `InsNextID`, checks
the sibling is an element whose `CreatedAt` is not covered by VV.

**Why End-token guard over range clamping**: Clamping works for text-level
ranges but fails for element-level ranges where the editor selected
children that moved to the split sibling. The guard handles both
uniformly:

- **Text-level** (range within element content): P's End token skipped →
  P' Start rejected by `canStyle` → no elements styled. Matches the
  unsplit behavior (no element tokens in range).
- **Element-level** (range across children): parent End token skipped →
  child Start token still styled via `canStyle`. Matches the unsplit
  behavior (child was in the original range).

### Fix 12: Copy attributes on split and propagate style to split siblings

**`SplitElement`** — Deep-copy the original node's attributes (`Attrs`)
to the split (right) node. Previously the right node was created with
nil attributes, losing any styling.

**`Style`, `RemoveStyle` callbacks** — After styling a node via its Start
token, follow the `InsNextID` chain and apply the same style/remove-style
to unknown split siblings (those whose `CreatedAt` is not covered by the
editor's VV). This ensures that a style operation whose range was
determined before a concurrent split also covers the right part.

Without this propagation, the client that splits first misses the style
on the right node, while the client that styles first copies it via the
attribute deep-copy in split — causing divergence.

Helper: `ticketKnown(vv, ticket)` — reused for the unknown-sibling check.

### Fix 13: Fix 7 propagation into recursive split loop

**`split` function** — The recursive split loop executes Fix 7
(`advancePastUnknownSplitSiblings`) at each iteration, not just before
the loop entry. Element splits produce non-deterministic IDs (new
tickets, unlike text splits which reuse `CreatedAt` + offset), so the
`InsNextID` chain is the only discovery path for concurrent element
split siblings.

The parent equality check in `advancePastUnknownSplitSiblings` is
relaxed (skipped) at ancestor iterations via `relaxParentCheck` flag.
A concurrent ancestor split may move siblings to different parents,
causing the strict check to break the chain prematurely. Same rationale
as Fix 11 (`hasUnknownSplitSibling`).

If the advance moves `left` to a node under a different parent, `parent`
is updated to match so `FindOffset` and `Split` operate on the correct
subtree.

### Fix 14: Include removed children in split loop offset

**`split` function** — `FindOffset` in the split loop now passes
`includeRemoved: true` to match `SplitElement`'s `Children(true)`
partition. Without this, tombstoned children before the split point
cause the visible-only offset to be smaller than the all-children
offset, misplacing the partition boundary.

### Fix 15: skipActorID in recursive split loop

**`advancePastUnknownSplitSiblings`** — New `skipActorID` option stops
advancement at siblings created by the current change's actor. In the
split loop, `issueTimeTicket` creates siblings with lamports beyond the
change's VV, making them appear "unknown". Without `skipActorID`, the
function advances past the current operation's own split products,
diverging from the clone path (VV=nil) where no advancement occurs.

Since a single actor's changes are always sequential, an "unknown"
sibling from the same actor is always our own creation, not a concurrent
one. This preserves clone/root consistency while still advancing past
genuine concurrent siblings from other actors.

Previous approach (advancing `left` to the just-created sibling after
`Split()`) achieved d1==d2 convergence but caused root tree structure to
diverge from clone in 308 cases — the convergence was artificial.

### Fix 16: Move concurrent inserts at split boundary to the left

**`SplitElement`** — After partitioning children into left/right, any
consecutive run of concurrent inserts (children whose `CreatedAt` is
unknown to the splitter's `VersionVector`) at the start of the right
partition is moved to the left partition. A concurrent insert placed
between the split boundary and the next original child was positioned
relative to the pre-split child order; its CRDT position (after a
left-partition child) means it should stay in the left partition.

## Convergence Coverage

### Hand-crafted integration suite (`test/integration/tree_test.go`)

| Category | Total | Pass |
|----------|------:|-----:|
| Basic Edit + Edit | 27 | 27 |
| Merge | 12 | 12 |
| Split | 14 | 14 |
| Style | 16 | 16 |
| **Total** | **69** | **69** |

### Property-based suite (`test/complex/tree_concurrency_test.go`)

| Suite | Pass | Skip (divergence) |
|---|---:|---:|
| EditEdit | 901 | 0 |
| StyleStyle | 145 | 0 |
| EditStyle | 85 | 0 |
| SplitSplit | 299 | 22 |
| SplitEdit | 140 | 5 |
| **Total** | **1570** | **27** |

Fixes 13-16 resolved 26 of the original 53 skipped `splitLevel >= 2`
divergences. The remaining 27 involve concurrent recursive splits where
children redistribution at the parent level produces order-dependent
results (see "Remaining Issue" below).

### Clone/root consistency

`syncClientsThenAssertEqual` and `syncClientsThenCheckEqual` now verify
that each document's clone tree XML matches its root tree XML after
sync. This catches bugs where `change.Execute(root, versionVector)`
produces a different tree structure from `change.Execute(clone, nil)`.

### Text vs Element ID asymmetry

Text split nodes have deterministic IDs (same `CreatedAt` + offset),
resolved by `findFloorNode`. Element split nodes have non-deterministic
IDs (new ticket from `issueTimeTicket`), discoverable only via the
`InsNextID` chain. This asymmetry is why Fixes 13-15 are needed
specifically for the recursive split path where multiple element splits
occur in sequence.

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Implicit move over explicit `TreeMove` op | Same fixes needed; Move adds protocol complexity |
| Persist `MergedFrom` + `MergedAt` in proto | Durable merge witness; `MergedAt` is immutable (unlike `removedAt` which LWW overwrites) |
| `mergedInto` as runtime cache only | Fast nil-check on hot path; rebuilt from `MergedFrom` on load |
| Derive moved-children on demand | `target.Children(true) | where MergedFrom == source.id`; call sites already have the target |
| Position-level fix for splits (Fix 7) | `collectBetween`-level fix can't distinguish contained vs side-by-side delete |
| End-token guard over range clamping (Fix 11) | Clamping fails for element-level ranges; guard handles both text and element uniformly |
| Relaxed parent check at ancestor splits (Fix 13) | Follows Fix 11 rationale: `InsNextID` is only set by `SplitElement`, so its existence is sufficient evidence |
| `includeRemoved` in split loop offset (Fix 14) | Must match `SplitElement`'s `Children(true)` partition to avoid boundary mismatch |
| `skipActorID` in split loop advancement (Fix 15) | Same-actor siblings are own split products, not concurrent; advancing past them diverges root from clone |
| Boundary insert migration in SplitElement (Fix 16) | CRDT position of concurrent insert is relative to pre-split child order; physical position after split is misleading |

## Remaining Issue: Recursive Split Children Redistribution

All 27 remaining divergences involve concurrent `splitLevel >= 2`
operations on the same node. The root cause:

When two clients both split node N at offset 0:
- Each locally takes all children into the split sibling (sibling is
  non-empty)
- On replay, N is already empty, so the replayed split creates an empty
  sibling

The level-1 (parent) split boundary is then placed differently:
- Client A: replays B's level-2, splits parent at offset 1 — A's
  non-empty sibling goes to the right
- Client B: parent was already split locally — A's empty replay sibling
  stays in the left

This produces different tree structures despite identical content.
The fix requires a mechanism in `SplitElement` to deterministically
redistribute children during concurrent splits, independent of
application order. This is architecturally different from the offset-
based fixes (13-16) and needs separate design.
