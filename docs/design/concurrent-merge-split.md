# Concurrent Merge and Split

## Problem

When two clients concurrently perform merge or split operations on the same
tree region, the replicas diverge after synchronization. This violates the
fundamental CRDT convergence guarantee.

### Goals

- Fix convergence bugs in concurrent merge/split so integration tests pass.
- Preserve backward compatibility: no protobuf or protocol changes.
- Keep all existing passing tests green.

### Non-Goals

- Undo/redo support for merge/split (deferred per `undo-redo.md` Phase 2).
- General-purpose `Tree.Move` operation (Phase 2).
- JS SDK changes (separate follow-up).

## Design

### Fix 1: Split sibling cascade delete

**Location**: `CRDTTree.collectBetween`

When an element node is marked for deletion, its `InsNextID` chain may contain
split siblings created by a concurrent `SplitElement`. If the version vector
does not know about the sibling's creation, the sibling was created by a
concurrent split and should be included in the deletion.

Only applies to element nodes. Text splits use offset-based IDs with the same
`CreatedAt`, so `findFloorNode` already resolves them correctly.

### Fix 2: Moved children guard

**Location**: `CRDTTree.collectBetween`

When `collectBetween` detects a merge (Start token with `!ended`), the merge-
source node appears in both `toBeRemoveds` and `toBeMergedNodes`. Its children
are being moved, not deleted. The parent-cascade check must exclude nodes
whose parent is in `toBeMergedNodes` to prevent merge-moved children from
being tombstoned by concurrent inserts.

### Fix 3: Merge-tombstone insert redirect

**Location**: `CRDTTree.FindTreeNodesWithSplitText`

When `FindTreeNodesWithSplitText` resolves a position whose parent has been
tombstoned by a merge, the insert should be redirected to the merge
destination. Uses `mergedInto` forwarding pointer when available (set by
Fix 4), otherwise scans the old parent's children for a child living in a
different parent.

### Fix 4: mergedInto forwarding pointer

**Location**: `CRDTTree.Edit` Step 04 (merge), `TreeNode` struct

Add runtime-only `mergedInto *TreeNodeID` and `mergedChildIDs []*TreeNodeID`
fields to `TreeNode`. No protobuf change — each replica computes these locally
when executing the merge operation.

When merge moves children from a source to `fromParent`:
1. Record each moved child's ID on its **actual source parent** only
   (not all `toBeMergedNodes`), to prevent cross-contamination in
   multi-boundary merges.
2. `DetachChild` from old parent (correct lengths, prevent ghost references).
3. `Append` to `fromParent`.
4. Set `source.mergedInto = fromParent.id`.

This decouples DetachChild from redirect: children are cleanly detached,
and the merge destination is still discoverable via `mergedInto`.

### Fix 5: Delete propagation via mergedChildIDs

**Location**: `CRDTTree.Edit` Step 04-1 (after merge)

When a merge-source node is fully deleted (in `toBeRemoveds` but not in
`toBeMergedNodes`), its former children in the merge target should also be
deleted. Follow `mergedChildIDs` to find and tombstone them, including their
full subtree (descendants of moved element nodes).

Skip propagation when `mergedInto` points to `fromParent` — this means a
prior local merge already moved the children, and the current operation is a
concurrent merge (not a delete).

### Fix 6: Inverted range no-op

**Location**: `CRDTTree.traverseInPosRange`

When a concurrent merge redirects the to-position into an earlier part of the
tree (before the from-position), the traversal range becomes empty because
the merge already handled the work. Treat `from > to` as a no-op instead of
an error.

### Fix 7: Split sibling forwarding

**Location**: `CRDTTree.Edit` Step 01-1 (between position resolution and
`collectBetween`)

When `SplitElement` creates a split sibling linked via `InsNextID`, the
sibling is unknown to concurrent editors whose positions were computed
against the unsplit tree. After resolving `fromLeft`/`toLeft` via
`FindTreeNodesWithSplitText`, advance each past element-type split siblings
whose `CreatedAt` is not covered by the editor's version vector.

This prevents three classes of bugs:
1. **Multi-level split**: the remote split's boundary resolves after all
   concurrent split products, producing the correct ancestor split point.
2. **Side-by-side insert**: the insert position lands after all split
   siblings, not between original and sibling.
3. **Side-by-side delete**: the delete range starts after split siblings,
   preventing traversal from passing through them and tombstoning their
   text children.

Skip advancement when `leftNode == parent` (leftmost child position) to
preserve "insert at front" semantics.

### Fix 8: SplitElement skips merge-moved children

**Location**: `TreeNode.SplitElement`, `CRDTTree.mergeNodes`

When a multi-level split (splitLevel ≥ 2) and a cross-boundary delete+merge
operate concurrently, `SplitElement` may move merge-moved children to the
split sibling, causing divergence. The fix anchors merge-moved children in
the merge destination so `SplitElement` does not relocate them.

Add runtime-only `mergedFrom *TreeNodeID` field to `TreeNode`. When merge
moves a child from its source parent to `fromParent`:
1. Set `child.mergedFrom = sourceParent.id` before detach and append.

In `SplitElement`, when partitioning children into left/right:
1. Children in the right partition whose `mergedFrom` is set are kept in the
   original node (appended to the left partition) instead of moving to the
   split sibling.

**Convergence proof** (main scenario):

```text
Initial: <root><p><p>ab</p><p>cd</p></p></root>
d1: Edit(3,3,nil,2) — split 'a|b' at level 2
d2: Edit(1,6,nil,0) — delete first inner <p>

d1 (split → merge): split creates outer_p', merge moves "cd" to outer_p.
  mergedFrom set on "cd" but split already done → no effect.
  Result: outer_p has "cd".

d2 (merge → split): merge moves "cd" to outer_p, sets mergedFrom.
  SplitElement on outer_p: "cd" has mergedFrom → skip, stays in outer_p.
  Result: outer_p has "cd".

Both: <root><p>cd</p><p></p></root> ✅
```

### Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Fix 1 cascade deletes too aggressively | Version vector check ensures only unknown-to-editor splits are cascaded. Element-only guard prevents text split interference |
| Fix 2 guard is too broad | Only applies when parent is in `toBeMergedNodes`, a pattern unique to merge |
| Fix 3 redirect fires on plain deletes | Redirect only when mergedInto is set or a living child exists in a different living parent |
| Fix 5 propagation deletes too much | Skip when mergedInto == fromParent (concurrent merge, not delete) |
| Fix 7 advances past known siblings | Version vector check ensures only unknown siblings are skipped. `leftNode == parent` guard preserves leftmost-child semantics |
| Fix 8 skips too many children | Only children with `mergedFrom` set are skipped. `mergedFrom` is only set during merge, so normal children are unaffected |

### Design Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Fix implicit move instead of explicit Move operation | All bugs require the same fixes regardless. Move adds protocol complexity with no additional convergence benefit |
| Element-only cascade for Fix 1 | Text splits use same-CreatedAt offset-based IDs that findFloorNode already resolves |
| Runtime-only mergedInto/mergedChildIDs | Keeps protobuf unchanged. Each replica computes locally during merge execution |
| Position-level fix for split siblings (Fix 7) | collectBetween-level fix proved infeasible — cannot distinguish contained delete (text should die) from side-by-side delete (text should survive) |
| No undo/redo in scope | Consistent with undo-redo.md Phase 2 deferral |
| Runtime-only `mergedFrom` on child nodes | Same pattern as `mergedInto`/`mergedChildIDs`. No protobuf change needed |
| Skip in SplitElement rather than post-reconciliation | Filtering during partition is simpler and preserves child ordering naturally |

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Why not |
|-------------|---------|
| Explicit `TreeMove` CRDT operation | Same fixes needed regardless. Adds protocol complexity with no additional convergence benefit |
| `mergedInto` as protobuf field | Runtime-only field suffices. No serialization needed since each replica computes it locally |
| Range-based Move (move all children after boundary) | Does not commute with concurrent inserts — divergence when applied in different order |
| Fix only at JS SDK level | Does not fix CRDT layer bugs. Go concurrency tests would still fail |
| Parent creation guard for split text nodes | Cannot distinguish contained delete (text should die) from side-by-side delete (text should survive) at collectBetween level |
| Always advance past split siblings (no VV check) | Breaks when editor knew about the split and intentionally positioned between original and sibling |
| Advance only fromLeft, not toLeft | Delete ranges need toLeft advancement to include split siblings of range-end node |
| Merge redirects to split sibling (Fix 8 alt) | Merge would need structural awareness of splits. Direction ambiguous when multiple siblings exist |
| Deterministic container selection (Fix 8 alt) | Requires generic comparison rule that interacts with all other fixes. Broad change surface |
| Post-split reconciliation (move children back) | Error-prone ordering, harder to reason about than filtering during partition |
