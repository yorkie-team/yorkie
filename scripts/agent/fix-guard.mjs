// What may a fix round change, and did it say anything it should not have?
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The fixer prompt has always said "stay in scope: modify only
// the flagged files unless a fix genuinely requires touching others". Prose was
// not enough. In October 2026 loop fixers added an auth-webhook TTL cache and
// an auth gate to a payload-hardening PR (#2111), version-vector caps and HLL
// proto changes to a GC-registration PR (#2100), and a revision-API rewrite to a
// document-size PR (#2108), each to satisfy a finding on code the PR did not
// touch — and each became new surface the next round reviewed. The same rounds
// left task files saying "the panel re-raised it", "stop raising this", "fifth
// re-filing": the fixer arguing with its reviewer inside the tree, where the
// next round reads it as part of the change.
//
// So the rule is now MECHANICAL, in two layers:
//
//   1. A pre-push hook in the fixer's checkout (`prepush`) refuses a push whose
//      commits touch a path outside the scope, and tells the fixer what to do
//      instead (revert it, dispute or skip the finding). Fast feedback, inside
//      the session, while the fixer can still act on it. The agent owns its
//      checkout and could remove the hook, so this is the guide, not the gate.
//   2. The trusted report job (`check`), on a fresh runner, reads the round's
//      own commits through the API and PAGES when any of them touched a path
//      outside the scope — or wrote reviewer-directed text. That is the gate.
//
// THE SCOPE is the PR's ORIGINAL diff — the files `main...<frozen>` changed,
// where `<frozen>` is the head at the FIRST fix dispatch (`review-surface.mjs`
// `frozenShaFrom`, the same unforgeable anchor the surface gate uses) — plus
// any test file and any documentation file. Tests and docs are open because
// writing a reproducer next to the code it covers, and recording a round in the
// task's lessons file, are exactly what a fix round is asked to do; they do not
// change what the product does.
//
// RUST (the `cargo` rule set) keeps most unit tests inside the source file
// they test, so "any test file" does not reach them: a reproducer written into
// `mod tests` of a file the pull request did not touch would be out of scope,
// and a path rule cannot tell that hunk from one in the function above it. So
// for a Rust file outside the scope the guard reads the WHOLE FILE on both
// sides of each commit and allows the change when it is confined to the
// file's test regions — top-level `#[cfg(test)] mod … { … }` blocks and
// `#[cfg(test)] mod …;` declarations (`cargo-rules.mjs` `testOnlyChange`:
// with the test regions taken out, the file must be the same tokens). That
// covers the three places a Rust reproducer goes: an existing `mod tests`, a
// new one at the bottom of a file, and a new `*_tests.rs` file (in scope by
// its name) with its one declaration line in the parent module. Whatever
// cannot be shown to be test-only — a file that was not read, does not lex,
// was added, renamed or deleted — stays out of scope, and pages.
//
// WHICH COMMITS ARE JUDGED, AND THE ONES THAT CANNOT BE. Both layers read the
// round's ordinary commits: one parent each, on the branch's own line. A
// change can also ride in a commit of another shape — typed into a merge
// commit, made on a side branch and merged in, or carried by a commit with no
// parent that is merged with `--allow-unrelated-histories` — and each of
// those used to reach neither layer. A fix round has one reason to make a
// merge: bringing the base branch in to resolve a conflict. So that one is
// allowed, when every parent but the first is already on the base branch and
// no file the merge left different from BOTH parents is out of scope (a file
// that differs from both sides is where a conflict was resolved, or where
// something was typed in). Any other merge, and any commit with no parent,
// is refused by the hook and paged by the report. So is a round with more
// commits than are read, and a round whose commits could not be listed: what
// was not judged is not "in scope".
//
// WHY PAGE AND NOT STRIP. Reverting the out-of-scope paths from a trusted job
// would need a second push path (the design doc names it as future work: the
// agent hands a bundle to a trusted job that pushes), and the in-scope half of
// the round may not build without the half that was stripped — a red CI then
// hands the PR to the CI-fix arm, whose fixer would put the code straight back.
// A page is the one response that cannot make the branch worse.
//
// THE LINT (`lintRound`) runs over the same commits and reports three things:
//
//   reviewer-directed text  BLOCKS (pages with the scope violation). Narrow
//                           phrases only — "stop raising", "the panel re-raised
//                           it", "fifth re-filing", "note to the reviewer" — on
//                           lines the round ADDED to docs/task files. The lens
//                           rubric already calls such text a major finding; the
//                           page saves a $12 panel round that would only say so.
//   weakened assertions     WARNS. A test file whose round removed more
//                           assertions than it added, or added a tautology. A
//                           refactor legitimately moves assertions, and
//                           test-removals.mjs already shows deleted tests to the
//                           adjudicator, so this is evidence, not a gate.
//   one-sided replicated    WARNS. A non-test change to a path the harness
//   rule                    configuration lists (`fixGuard.replicatedRuleGlobs`)
//                           changes a rule a counterpart repository must apply
//                           identically or replicas diverge. This repo cannot
//                           see the counterpart, so it can only ask. A
//                           repository with no such rule lists no paths.
//
// Usage:
//   node fix-guard.mjs allowed <pr> [--base main] --out <file>
//   node fix-guard.mjs prepush --allowed <file> [--base main]  (git pre-push hook)
//   node fix-guard.mjs check <pr> --before <sha> --after <sha> [--base main]
//       [--pusher <login> --since <iso> --branch <name>] [--github-output]
// `check` posts one `<!-- agent-fix-guard -->` comment when it has anything to
// say and writes `blocking=true|false` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT. It exits 0 except when
// a blocking page could not be posted, so a net still sees the failure.
