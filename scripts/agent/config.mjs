// The single read path for a repository's harness configuration.
//
// Everything under `scripts/agent/` is meant to be the same bytes in every
// repository that runs this harness. What differs between repositories — which
// paths define CI, which globs are source, what the mechanical lanes prove, the
// names of the bots — lives in ONE directory outside this package,
// `.github/agent-harness/`, and this module is the only thing that reads it:
//
//   config.json        every value, validated against SCHEMA below
//   coverage-note.md   the mechanical-coverage note, as prose
//
// WHERE THE DIRECTORY IS. By default it is resolved from this file's own
// location: `<root>/scripts/agent/config.mjs` reads
// `<root>/.github/agent-harness/`. That is what makes the trust model work
// without a flag: a workflow that checks the default branch out into `.trusted/`
// gets `.trusted/scripts/agent` and `.trusted/.github/agent-harness` from the
// same commit, and a script run from there can only reach the configuration
// beside it — never the pull request's copy in the workspace.
//
// Some jobs stage this package on its own (`cp -R scripts/agent
// "$RUNNER_TEMP/agent-tools"`), which drops the parent directories the default
// is resolved through. Those jobs copy the configuration from the same trusted
// checkout and name it with `AGENT_HARNESS_CONFIG_DIR`. The override must be an
// ABSOLUTE path: a relative one would be resolved against the working
// directory, which in those jobs is the pull request's checkout — the one
// place the configuration must never be read from.
//
// THE DEFAULT APPLIES ONLY IN PLACE. Two directories up from a staged copy is
// not a repository root, it is wherever the copy happened to land — the
// parent of the runner's temp directory, say — and a `.github/agent-harness`
// that happened to exist there would be read as if it were trusted. So the
// default is used only when this file really sits at `<root>/scripts/agent/`;
// anywhere else, the variable is required and its absence throws.
//
// NO DEFAULTS, ANYWHERE. A missing directory, a missing file, a missing key or
// a value of the wrong type throws. Falling back to a built-in value would let
// a gate keep running on a list that is quietly shorter than the repository's
// own — the failure would look exactly like a pass. Callers do not catch what
// this throws; an uncaught error exits non-zero, which is the visible outcome.
//
// `command.mjs` DOES NOT IMPORT THIS, and must not: route jobs check that one
// file out alone, where neither this module nor the configuration exists.
//
// Usage:
//   node config.mjs get <dotted.key>     a string is printed raw, anything
//                                        else as JSON; exit 1 on any failure

// ONE DIALECT, for every glob the harness matches a path against — the

//
//   **    as a whole path segment: any number of directories, including none.
//         `**/x` matches `x` and `a/b/x`; `a/**` matches everything under `a/`;
//         alone, it matches every path.
//   *     inside a segment: any run of characters that is not a separator.
//   else  literal.
//
// Paths are repository-relative with `/` separators, and a glob is anchored at
// both ends — so a bare `dir` matches only a path that is exactly `dir` (write
// `dir/**` for its contents), and `*.ext` matches only at the root (write
// `**/*.ext` for any depth). Those two are valid globs and cannot be refused
// here; a repository's `repo.test.mjs` catches them by requiring every
// configured entry to match a tracked file. NOTHING ELSE IS SUPPORTED, and what is not supported is REFUSED
// rather than read literally: these lists are refusal surfaces and review
// scopes, so a pattern in another tool's syntax — `{a,b}`, `!negated`, `./x`,
// `dir/`, `a?b` — would compile, match no path, and quietly take that entry
// off the list. `globProblem` says why; `compileGlob` throws it.
