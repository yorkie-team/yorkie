## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.24+
- Istioctl 1.17+
- Helm 3+

## Install Istio with Istio Operator

Before installing the chart, you need to install Istio with [Istio Operator](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/operator/) using [istioctl](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/#download).

```bash
istioctl install -f <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/main/build/charts/yorkie-cluster/istio-operator.yaml)
```

## Get Helm Repository Info

```bash
helm repo add yorkie-team https://yorkie-team.github.io/yorkie/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

_See [`helm repo`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo/) for command documentation._

## Install Helm Chart

```bash
# Install yorkie cluster helm chart
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] yorkie-team/yorkie-cluster
```

_See [configuration](#configuration) below for custom installation_

_See [`helm install`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) for command documentation._

## Uninstall Helm Chart

```bash
helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]
```

This removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

_See [`helm uninstall`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for command documentation._

Also, you need to uninstall istio with [istioctl](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/#download).

```bash
istioctl uninstall --purge
```

This will remove all the istio components including CRDs.

## Upgrading Chart

```bash
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] yorkie-team/yorkie-cluster
```

With Helm v3, CRDs created by this chart are not updated by default and should be manually updated.

_See [`helm upgrade`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for command documentation._
